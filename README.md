# Change Scene Issues in Godot 3d Networking Multiplayer Template

after the scene change when your player approaches the red cube, when you click return, it goes back to the main scene with menu visible where you have to create a new host and server. 

I'm thinking it would be nice to go back to the scene without main menu and use the existing connection created.
